# Welcome to Loshion's Guide to Writing Stardew Dialogue in 1.6! 
This repository is meant for new mod authors looking for a simple guide on dialogue creation using Content Patcher. 

I'm not well versed in creating C# mods, so this is strictly a resource on creating content using Content Patcher.

## Contents
Use the branches drop down (above) to switch between each area or just click the links below.

[Writing Guide](https://github.com/loshionbottle/Writing-Stardew-Dialogue/blob/Welcome/WritingContent.md) - Takes information from both my experience and from the Stardew Dialogue WIKI and puts it all into a pretty package just for u pookie.

[Code Skeletons](https://github.com/loshionbottle/Writing-Stardew-Dialogue-1.6/tree/Welcome/1.6%20Skeleton) - Skeletons for both Non-Marriagable and Marriagable NPCs. Designed with Beginners in mind, so there's a lot of inlines to delete. 


*All Resources here are FREE to use and should stay that way. I do not intend for myself or any others to profit off of this.*
