# Loshion's Guide to Writing Stardew Dialogue in 1.6! 
This repository is meant for new Mod Authors looking for a simple guide on dialogue creation using Content Patcher. 
I'm not well versed in creating C# mods, so this is strictly a helpful resource on creating content using Content Patcher.

# A quick rundown on what's included: 
### Code Skeletons
Includes skeletons for marriagable and non-marriagable NPCs
### Writing Guide
Includes a guide on how to edit these skeletons
### Other Resources
